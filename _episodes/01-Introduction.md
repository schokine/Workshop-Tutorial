## Introduction?

The workshop tuorial is based on a lesson on LIVIVO which is an interdisciplinary search engine for literature and information in the field of life sciences (medicine, health, nutrition, and environmental and agricultural sciences). It is run by ZB MED â€“ Information Centre for Life Sciences. LIVIVO draws on relevant scientific information from the ZB MED subject areas of medicine, health, nutrition, and environmental and agricultural sciences. It enables researchers to find what they need for free using a standardised search interface. In many cases, items can then be retrieved online, either by accessing them directly or placing an order. We can also arrange for items to be delivered straight to your home using the document delivery service (subito). Alternatively, you can request items to be sent to your local library through the inter-library loan service.
